		<div class="col-1-2">
		<p>We value the feedback that is provided by those who visit and join our Village Community.
		We update our website monthly with new stories, pictures, experiences and feedback from Village 
		members and visitors. Would you like to share your child's story and/or experiences with therapy 
		types, IEPs/504s, school-based therapies, or anything else you feel might benefit another parent 
		on this	journey?  Would you like to become a member of our Village that is available to talk, 
		support and/or meet up with other parents who are feeling lost, overwhelmed or just want another 
		parent's perspective on things they are going through?</p>

		<p>If you answered yes to any of the above, please send us an email, <a href="mailto:anniesaenz515@gmail.com">anniesaenz515@gmail.com</a>,
		or give us a call,<a href="tel:+18173089045">817-308-9045</a>. We usually respond to emails and 
		voicemails within 24 hours. Your information will only be shared in the manner that you give us 
		permission to disclose. We have a list of Village members that are available via email, phone 
		and/or in person to help you in any way that they can. If you would feel more comfortable remaining 
		annonymous but want to share your child's story and/or experiences, please let us know and we will 
		provide the valuable information while maintaining complete confidentiality. You can choose to remove 
		yourself from the list of Village members at any time as well. We respect your privacy and your 
		valuable time.</p>

		<p>We all understand how crazy busy our lives can be but we all remember what it was like to be 
		at a point in this journey where we felt like we were barely keeping our heads above water. Our 
		goal is to simply be the a support system regardless of what part of the journey you are in. I,
		myself, have been on this journey with my son Ricky for almost 20 years. I still need support and
		learn things from other parents all the time. We are stronger when we are united together. And 
		together we can not only make a difference in each other's lives and the lives of our children, but
		hopefully we can bring more awareness to those around us as well.</p>

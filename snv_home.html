	<p>We are a community of parents, family, friends, caretakers, paraprofessionals and 
	teachers who have come together to provide information, resources, personal experiences 
	and support to all who need a companion	along this incredible journey of caring for our 
	special kids.</p>
	
	<p>As the mother of son with CP, I understand how scary and overwhelming it can be for 
	your child to be diagnosed with something that you may have heard of but really know 
	nothing about. It can be confusing trying to find even	basic information and frustrating 
	trying to keep track of all the things that you may possibly need to research. Having 
	other parents who are going through a special needs journey is not only comforting and 
	uplifting but most of the time it is a necessity in order to even decipher the direction 
	to go at any given point.</p>
	
	<p>Each page provides information, an experience, links to resources and/or ways
	to arm yourself with knowledge, know that you are not alone. There is information 
	on ways that you can provide helpful information/experiences that we can pass along 
	to others so that they might find the path a little easier as well.</p>

	<p>Please feel free to bookmark any of the links you choose to visit. We also recommend
	having a journal handy during your research times online as you can write down things to
	discuss or ask questions about with your child's care team. You may also find it helpful 
	to write down your thoughts and feelings as you learn more and ponder over the many types
	of decisions you may need to make in regard to the information you find here or on any of
	the sites you visit.</p>

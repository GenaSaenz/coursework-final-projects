		<h3>Our Mission Statement</h3>
		  <blockquote>
			&#34;Connecting music lovers and supporters with the best local bands and venues in DFW, while
			 connecting bands with venues and helping them grow their fan base. All for the love of Music!&#34;
		  </blockquote>
			<br>
		<h3>Welcome to Our Community!</h3>
		<p>We have all had that thought or conversation about making plans for the evening or weekend and trying 
		 to figure out the best spots to go hear live, local music and possibly venturing to unknown venues. This 
		 is where we come in. You can find local band info, events and venues all in one place for quick and easy
		 planning. We even have links to show where some of the best parking in Deep Ellum is. You can join our 
		 community and receive email notification of upcoming events in your selected areas and/or venues, provide
		 feedback and even pass on information about local bands/artists and venues that you feel should be 
		 featured on our page. Bands/artists and venues can also become members and provide information to be 
		 featured regarding events, pricing, upcoming tours, and links to their website. </p>
		 <br>
		 <h3>Come Visit Us!</h3>
		 <p>We welcome visitors to stop by and see what we do and chat with us!</p>

		<h3>All for the Love of Music!</h3>
		<p>We are proud to support our local music scenes and venues! We want to help you find events for bands
		 you are already supporting and new bands/artists that you might not have found otherwise. We always 
		 appreciate feedback regarding shows you attend and pictures you share are often featured to give our 
		 community the full experience. We provide information across a multitude of genres so there is something
		 for everyone. We cannot promise you won't have to make hard choices on which awesome show to attend but 
		 we can promise that you will have plenty to choose from!</p>

	   to your list of plans for the upcoming week. We will also announce the 
	   next week's guest so that you guys can send us your "need to know" 
	   questions, stellar reviews and shoutouts and even enter to win a chance
	   to come in to the studio for a meet and greet along with 2 tickets to the
	   next local show or passes into the venue! You can keep track with our

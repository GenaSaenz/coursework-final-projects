<p>Down Syndrome is a congenital disorder arising from a chromosome 
defect, causing intellectual impairment and physical abnormalities 
including short stature and a broad facial profile. It arises from 
a defect involving chromosome 21, usually an extra copy (trisomy-21).
There are three types of Down syndrome: <i>trisomy 21</i> (nondisjunction), 
<i>translocation</i> and <i>mosaicism</i>. One in every 691 babies in the United 
States is born with Down syndrome, making Down syndrome the most 
common genetic condition. All 3 types of Down syndrome are genetic 
conditions (relating to the genes), but only 1% of all cases of Down 
syndrome have a hereditary component. Down syndrome is usually 
identified at birth by the presence of certain physical traits: low 
muscle tone, a single deep crease across the palm of the hand, a 
slightly flattened facial profile and an upward slant to the eyes.<p>

<p>Children with Down Syndrome can often benefit from speech therapy, 
occupational therapy, and exercises to help improve their motor 
skills. They might also be helped by special education and attention 
at school. Most therapies are started (and continued) through an at 
home therapy service or in a therapy clinic. Schools usually provide
some of these services on a more basic level as well.<p>

<p>Some of common medical problems in people with Down Syndrome include 
cataracts, hearing problems, thyroid problems, and seizure disorders. 
Health conditions such as Congenital heart disease, intestinal issues 
(blocked small bowel or esophagus), Celiac disease, skeletal problems 
and Dementia that is smiliar to Alzheimers are also areas to be 
informed about and speak with your care team about. Below are some 
helpful links to information and resourcs associated with Down Syndrome.</p>

	<p>My name is Annie. I have been blessed with an amazing son
	Ricky. Ricky has Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy. He was 
	born 8 weeks early at only 32 weeks gestation. He weighed 
	4 pounds, 10.4 oz and was 17 inches long. He had to stay 
	in the hospital for one month after his birth to give him
	time to learn how to breath on his own, develop the sucking
	reflex so that he could eat without using an Ng tube and be
	able to eat without forgetting to breathe. I was 16 when he 
	was born and it was the ultimate push from being a teenager
	to an adult as I not only became a mother, but I became the 
	mother of a child who was fighting for his life.</p>

	<p>During our stay in the NICU we were told that there were a
	slew of possible health conditions and developmental delays
	that could surface due to him being born premature. He did 
	so well and was ready to be released sooner than they 
	predicted which caused the care team to dismiss multiple 
	issues that did not appear before he was released. He seemed
	to be fine and on track until around the 6 month mark. He was 
	not rolling over, trying to sit up and his legs began to be 
	more and more stiff as he grew. He finally started to "Army" 
	crawl by dragging himself with his arms at around 10 months 
	and be able to roll himself around as well. After missing 
	several milestones we were referred to a neurologist who
	ordered an MRI. He was diagnosed with CP at 18 months old.</p>

	<p>We started physical, occupational and speech thearpies right
	away. He was also fitted for dAFOs to help his heelcords 
	stretch out and place his feet in the proper position of 
	flexing, especially while standing for short periods of time.
	At 6, we decided to go with the Baclofen pump as a means to 
	give his body some help with decreasing some of the spasticity.
	At the time there was not enough significant research to give 
	me confidence in pursing the Selective Dorsal Rhiszotomy route.
	He was able to start walking short distances using a walker and
	to stand for short periods of time in a stander in order to help
	his body stretch. He never gained enough strength or decreased 
	enough spasticity to move independenly without a wheelchair. But
	this has not stopped him one bit. He continued to receive therapy
	at home and at school in his special needs classroom.</p>

	<p>Ricky played wheelchair basketball and found that he enjoys bowling.
	He is able to shower, eat, and go out an about in our neighborhood 
	and at school on his own. He went to prom, homecoming and graduated high
	school this year. We have found ways to include him in everything that 
	we do and he has been able to go out and do stuff on my aunt and uncle's 
	ranch as they load him up and let him drive their Rhino with his cousin Riley. 
	He will never be able to drive a car as his eye muscles do not work together well
	enough to provide adequate depth perception for safe driving but he has 
	plenty of people that will drive him whereever he wants/needs to go. He 
	lives a fairly normal 19 year old life as far as daily tasks and we are in
	the process of finding him a part time job. It hasn't been easy and some
	days are harder than others but we work together to make sure he has the best
	life that we can give him. I believe his most treasured gift is that he teaches 
	people everyday what it means to make the most of each day and find a way to do 
	what you want to do. He has his moods but he is such a caring and loving kid that 
	you can't help but become attached to him.</p>

	<p>Our lives have been forever changed and full of extra blessing because we
	have Ricky in our lives. I am glad that God trusted me with such a gift as
	this life is not easy and my mama heart has been broken many times as I have
	watched him find his place in this world of people who do not take the time
	to get to know our amazingly different and special kiddos. I hope and pray 
	that as time goes by he will find more and more people to add to his circle 
	that will not only be a blessing to him but that he may bless them as well.</p>

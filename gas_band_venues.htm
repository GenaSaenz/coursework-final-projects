		<p>Dallas has always played a role in the local and national music scene. The venues
		  and genres represent a multitude of cultures and diversity. We are highlighting 
          some of our favorites, as well as, our most recommended venues, local bands and
          artists. Deep Ellum is where the majority of music lovers venture when seeking 
		  a good time, something new or just following bands/artists they love and support.
		  There are still a few places outside of Deep Ellum that we will provide.</p>
		 <br>
		 <p><img src="fort-worth-sundance.jpg#ftw" ALIGN="center" alt="Fort Worth nighttime skyline image" /></p>
		 <hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:none;background-color:none">
		 <p>Fort Worth has played a role in the local music scene for a long time but until
		  recently it was often overlooked for venues and local bands/artists in Dallas, 
		  specifically in Deep Ellum. Thanks in part to the new interest in rejuvenating 
		  certain areas of Downtown, the addition of Panther Island and of course the historic
		  Stockyards, Fort Worth is building up its place in the diverse music scene. Those
		  of us local to Fort Worth are beyond excited to see it grow and be as big in the
		  local music scene as Dallas and Deep-Ellum in genres outside of Country.</p>

		<p><img src="deep-ellum.jpg#deep-ellum" ALIGN="center" alt="Deep-Ellum sign, nighttime image" /></p>
		 <hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:none;background-color:none">
		<p>Deep Ellum is most certainly a cornerstone in the DFW music scene. From well
		  promoted, nationally syndicated bands and venues to the awesome hidden-gem 
		  venues that are as diverse as the metroplex itself. You are bound to run into
		  someone you know locally or even a few famous faces if you frequent as often 
		  as we do. There is something for everyone located within the mesmerizing and 
		  intoxicating area that is known as Deep Ellum. </p>	
		<br>
		<p><img src="denton.jpg#denton" ALIGN="center" alt="Denton Square, nighttime image" /></p>
		 <hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:none;background-color:none">
		<p>Denton is not as well known in the music scene but has recently been making a
		  name for itself with local musicians. The annual Jazz festival held in May is a
		  big deal and is well known and visited by people from all over. UNT has an 
		  excellent music program which helps keep the diverse and growing music scene in
		  people's ears and on their lists. While most of the venues are not big or as 
		  prominent on "best of" lists, they are interesting and keep us frequenting the 
		  area in search of more!</p>	
	<br>
		<p>We will display local bands and venues for each of the DFW locations mentioned
		 on this page on the Dallas/Deep Ellum page and the Fort Worth/Denton page. Please
		 check out these pages as they will have location specific venues and bands listed.
		 And each band/venue will have a link to their individual website or Facebook page
		 located on the <a href="gas_links.htm" title="Link to page of links."/ id="links">
		 Links page.</a> Explore the multitude of options and get ready to have a list of 
		 places to visit and bands to see that will keep you entertained and full of surprises!</p>

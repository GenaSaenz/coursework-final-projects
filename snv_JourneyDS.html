	<p>My name is Jodie and I am Ryder's mama. Ryder has Standard
	Trisomy 21, which is a type of Down Syndrome. When I was 13 
	weeks pregnant they did an ultrasound to look for a nuchal fold, 
	he had the fold. At 20 weeks pregnant they sent me to a 
	specialist to have another one. The specialist stated that there 
	was a 5% chance that he would have Down Syndrome. When he was born 
	they told us they couldn't tell for sure. He had the Simian crease 
	and planters gap on his toes but when we looked at him we could only 
	see the "Downs look" sometimes. He had no health or feeding issues 
	so we were discharged the next day.</p>

	<p>Before discharging us home they did do a blood test to test for it.
	2 weeks later we received the official diagnosis, the test came back
	positive. We cried hard for what it meant for Ryder but 30 minutes
	later we quit, hugged him tight and moved forward. We never cared if he
	had Down Syndrome or not, and we refused the amnio after the 2 ultrasounds.
	He was our beautiful baby either way.</p>

  <div class="col-1-2">
	<p>He started speech and occupational therapy at 1 year old. At 3 years
	old he started preschool where he received speech, occupational and 
	speech therapies. He is still receiving speech and occupation therapies
	at school as part of his curriculum.He is in a special needs classroom 
	but goes to a general ed classroom for an hour each day. He also 
	participates in PE, music and art with the general ed classes. He has 
	the BEST teacher in the world and we are so happy!</p>
	

	<p>Ryder is a part of everything we do as a family. He has 4 brothers that
	love and include him. He helps out on our ranch, raises and shows animals for
	the fair and loves taking pictures. He has chores and is a fully included
	part of our family system. We thank God every day for entrusting us with this
	precious gift! We are better people becasue of our special and amazing son.
	If you ever want the best hug, need a smile or want to fill your heart burst
	with love, surround yourself with people who have Down Syndrome. Your life 
	will be forever blessed!</p>

		 <em>Design Document</em>
		</h2>
		<h3 id="doc">Purpose and Summary of Site</h3>
		 <p>The purpose of this website is to provide an easier way for
		  people seeking new venues and/or bands to find both in one place.
		  By providing pictures, information, and links for both venues and
		  bands along with them being divided up based on location in DFW,
		  we have the ability to not only attrack those seeking something new
		  but also provide a place for venues and bands alike to promote and
		  showcase themselves.</p>

		<h3 id="doc">Audiences</h3>
		 <p>The primary audience(s) of this site will be music lovers who 
		  are in search of a better place to find information and links to
		  multiple venues and bands/artists in a one-stop fashion. The other
		  portion of the primary audience will be the venues and bands/artists
		  themselves as they find that we provide a place to not only market and
		  promote themselves but can also receive feedback from our visitors via
		  our staff. The secondary audience will most likely be the people who 
		  are bored or just looking for something different to do some night during
		  the week or weekend.</p>

		<h3 id="doc">Background of the Audiences</h3>
		 <p>The background of our audiences will fall in line with their 
		  main purpose in visiting our site. The true music lovers will
		  visit us because they can find new and different music, bands, 
		  artists and venues to enhance their journey of growing their
		  collection and expanding their minds and palletes. The bands,
		  artists and venues will be in search of a solid place to not
		  only showcase and promote their talent but also to have the 
		  ability to get that feedback in return. Both of these audiences 
		  are going to be generally on at least an intermediate level of 
		  technology and internet savvy level. The happen-by-chance, Google
		  searchers will find that they can not get information to make plans
		  but may find multiple venues and bands/artists that they now want 
		  to look into further. This audience will be more of an across the 
		  board group as some may be novices with technology and the internet
		  while others are advanced levels in both. Our site is easy to use 
		  for a novice level user but advanced enough not to put off higher
		  level users.</p>
		  
		  <h3 id="doc">Website Message</h3>
		 <p>The message of this website is to encourage and foster a strong
		  local music scence community in DFW by providing a place that not
		  only entices and informs music lovers but bands, artists and venues
		  as well. Its purpose is to bring DFW's local music scene together
		  with the various parts that make up the community as a whole. By 
		  placing area specific, venue specific and genre specific information
		  all in one place but in a way that actually combines all three 
		  together creating a versitale and reliable source for all parties
		  involved. And the best part is that we provide a platform that 
		  gives people the ability to find things that they might not find
		  otherwise due to frustration, lack of time to search mutliple sites
		  and/or plain novice level skills.</p>

		<h3 id="doc">Scope</h3>
		 <p>This website provides enough detail and information coupled with
		  links to provide a variety of users the ability to find what they 
		  need to make plans, visit a venue, go see and hear new music and 
		  even follow them on their individual sites. While we do not have
		  detailed information about each and every band or venue at this time,
		  we do plan to grow the site within the year to give more attention to 
		  bands and their events, merchandise, links to tickets and more. We do
		  provide a members area that allows bands/artists and venues to connect,
		  music lovers to receive personalized emails with upcoming events and
		  information about the bands/artists and venues they choose to follow
		  from our memeber's area listings. We will also be adding a live video
		  stream each Sunday evening, beginning in August, that will allow all 
		  visitors and members to have a more personal relationship with our 
		  staff and the guests on our show. We will not promote, feature, 
		  showcase or market for a single area, venue, band or artist.</p>

		<h3 id="doc">Goal of Our Site</h3>
		 <p>Our primary goal is to encourage and continue building the local music 
		  scene throughout the entire Metroplex and across all genres by providing
		  a knowledgeable and friendly staff who work tirelessly to ensure that 
		  any and all information on our site is accurate and correct at all times.
		  This allows for an enhanced experience when searching for the best of the
		  best in DFW, whether it be a venue, a band, an artist or just a place to
		  find ideas for last minute plans. We strive to bring the DFW music scene
		  and its community together by providing a place that offers information,
		  uses its users feedback to better the site and giving a voice to the
		  lesser known but still AWESOME venues, bands, artists all while feeding 
		  our fellow music lovers searching minds and ears new fuel for their fires.</p>

		<h3 id="doc">Site Navigation</h3>
		 <p>Global and local navigation are provided through links at the top of
		  each page that are consistent in placement and design. There are also
		  several color highlighted words throughout the site that are links to 
		  either the Links page, Dictionary.com for a definition, outside websites,
		  or to this document itself. The use of a dropdown button for target link 
		  navigation is provided on the Links page. The email graphic is also a link 
		  to the Feedback page. And lastly, there are links to each webpage on this 
		  site available for use on the Sitemap page.</p>

		<h3 id="doc">Organizational Structure</h3>
		 <p>This website uses mostly the Webs information structure but there are 
		  also parts that would fall under the Hierarchy information structure and
		  even the linear structure.</p>

		<h3 id="doc">The Site Outline</h3>
		 <p>The way I went about creating the outline for this site is pretty much
		  in conjunction with the way the Sitemap page works. I thought about what
		  the primary focus was, what I wanted to present, how I wanted to divide 
		  and cover each topic/element and the flow I felt would be most conducive
		  regardless of user level of experience and tech/internet savvy.</p>

		 <ol id="doc">
		   <li id="doc">Home Page-About Us</li>
		   <li id="doc">Bands/Venues</li>
			 <ol>
			   <li id="doc">Our Favorites</li>
			   <li id="doc">A little about the different DFW areas</li>
			   <li id="doc">Bands/Venues specific to Dallas and Deep Ellum</li>

			 <li id="doc">A place to find the various band/venue and parking links</li>
			 <li id="doc">This design document which I feel works best at the far right</li>
		 </ol>

		 <p>The outline gave me a good idea of how I wanted to set up the site
		  what would go on each page and where in the navigation order I felt
		  it would work best overall. This in turn gave me an easy way to build
		  my Sitemap page as well.</p>

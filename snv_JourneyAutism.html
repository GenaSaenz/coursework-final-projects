	<p>My name is Cindy and I would like to share a
	little part of my son Noah's journey with Autism.
	Noah is 9 years old and currently in 3rd grade. 
	He is in General Ed with Resource support. He goes
	to the Resource classroom to receive speech, social,
	occupational and behavioral therapy (including brushing).
	He also goes to his Resource classroom when he is becoming
	overwhelmed in his regular classroom.</p> 

	<p>It took 2 years to get Noah diagnosed with Autism,
	specifically PDD-NOS (Pervasive Developmental Disorder-
	Not Otherwise Specified). This is a super high functioning
	type of Autism but it is also a very rare type and there
	is currently not a lot of information about it. After 
	fighting with the school he was attending I took him to
	the Crystal Cherry Ball Foundation in Dallas, TX and Cook
	Children's Hospital network in Fort Worth, TX. He was 4 
	years old when we finally had an official diagnosis.</p>

	<p>I knew something was going on but did not know how to help.
	It broke my heart daily. He would have fits, was nonverbal,
	would scream without stopping, and it would require me to 
	physically compress him to calm him down. I would sit him on my
	lap, tightly wrap my arms around him and then wrap my legs over
	his in "criss-cross applesauce" style. After continued therapies,
	most specifically brushing therapy, he started to gain control,
	speaks very well and a lot now, walks on his own, makes eye
	contact, initiates conversations and recently even started wanting
	to try to write things in class instead of just verbally provide
	responses for his work.</p>
</div>
	<!-- Right Column -->
  <div class="col-1-2">
	<p>He still has some OCD type tendencies that can cause some tension
	but has continued to gain control of his outbursts and now uses 
	his words to let his teachers and us know when he needs a break.
	He is allowed to wear earphones at school to help with situations
	that he feels overwhelmed in due to noise levels. He can also ask
	to go to his Resource classroom to give himself space and time to 
	calm down. This is a major improvement as before he would scream,
	cover his ears, run out and even sometimes take off his clothes in
	frustration. He has also learned to stay on track and get where he
	is supposed to be going without wandering off by using a timer that
	he carries between classes to let him know when he is supposed to
	be at the other classroom.</p>

	<p>He has pretty bad allergies to nuts and cow's milk so we control
	his diet quite a bit. Once we learned this and altered his diet
	we also noticed that he calmed down. He was having lots of pain
	and digestive issues that we were unsure of the cause until tests
	were ran at his GI doctor's office. The combination of controlling
	his diet, the various therapies, the consistency between home and 
	school, new information we learn and lots of love and patience have
	contributed to Noah's success in continually growing and functioning
	more independently and on-level with other kids his age. Don't get me
	wrong, some days are still a struggle and may always be, but the 
	progress we continue to see and the life lessons we learn from 
	loving him are beautiful parts of our lives that we would never 
	change.</p>

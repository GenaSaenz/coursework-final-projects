		 <hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:none;background-color:none">
		<p>Lola's is one of our favorite spots! Brian Forella opened Lola's in 2007
		 and it has become not only a local favorite hot spot but is also a nationally
		 recoginized venue. They host one of the widest varieties of 
		 <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/genre" title="Link to genre definition" id="definition">genres</a> 
		 around and bands and artists, both local and touring, consider it "home". 
		 Lola's has seriously helped cultivate the music scene in Fort Worth by 
		 providing a venue that rivals those that would normally be chosen in Dallas
		 instead. We highly recommend that you check out this awesome venue and partake 
		 in some serious musical talent as you will find something that everyone will like!

		 <p><img src="foundry.jpg#foundry" ALIGN="center" alt="The Foundry logo image" /></p>
		 <hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:none;background-color:none">
		 <p>The Foundry is another of our favorite spots. This is definitely not your
		  usual venue. On one side you have their delicious resturant The Chicken Scratch
		  and then you have bar area on the other. Food, drinks and places to relax and 
		  hang out are located inside the shipping containers that have been transformed.
		  There is also a nice outdoor patio area with picnic tables and all. The stage is
		  located outside in the patio area where a wide variety of bands and artist perform 
		  on Friday and Saturday nights. You will feel warm and welcome here in the laid back,
		  dog friendly atmosphere. We highly recommend visiting this hidden gem located in 
		  Oak Cliff. Check out our <a href="gas_links.htm" title="Link to page of links."/ id="links">links page</a>

		 <p><img src="1919_hemphill.jpg#1919" ALIGN="center" alt="1919 Hemphill club logo image" /></p>
		 <hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:none;background-color:none">
		 <p>1919 Hemphill is a 14 year veteran to the punk scene but they also feature many other 
		 genres in an all ages welcome atmosphere. Their motto of "No booze, no drugs, no jerks" 
		 keeps this ecletic DIY venue a favorite for people of all ages. It is located in an area
		 of southern Fort Worth that thrives on turning once abandoned buildings into artsy spaces.
		 There are couches and chairs in one area, inspiring graffit on the walls and an in your face
		 stage area that creates an energy that can only be felt and described after visiting. We love 
		 this hole in the wall venue and look forward to upcoming shows. Definitely try this place out 
		 at least once!

		<p><img src="fredstx.jpg#freds" ALIGN="center" alt="Fred's Texas Cafe image" /></p>
		<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:none;background-color:none">
		<p>Fred's Texas Cafe is not only a great place to enjoy live, local music but 
		 the food and drinks are phenomenal as well! The outdoor patio area is covered
		 and the stage sits in the center. We love visiting here often for the music,
		 food and ice cold drinks. This is a family friendly venue and a great date spot
		 as well. Definitely check out Fred's! Check out our <a href="gas_links.htm" title="Link to page of links."/ id="links">links page</a>

		<p><img src="scat-jazz.jpg#scat" ALIGN="center" alt="Scat Jazz Lounge image" /></p>
		<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:none;background-color:none">
		<p>The Scat Jazz Lounge gives that authentic speak-easy fell. It is located below
		 street level in Sundance Square which adds to the element of the era. You can catch
		 local and national acts throughout the week. The vibe is very grown and sexy but chill
		 and relaxing. We venture here at least once a month. Perfect place to bring a date!

		 <br>
		<p><img src="buttons_logo.png#buttons" ALIGN="center" alt="Buttons Restaurant image" /></p>
		<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:none;background-color:none">
		<p>Buttons is definitely one of our favorites as well. The food is delicious (you have
		 to try the made from scratch Chicken&Waffles plate!), the drinks are ice cold with a
		 decent variety, and the live music is superb. This place has a down-home vibe that will
		 warm your heart and soul. This place is a must visit and we frequent as often as possible.

		 <p><img src="rail-club.jpg#railclub" ALIGN="center" alt="Rail Club image" /></p>
		<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:none;background-color:none">
		<p>If you are looking for a local venue that is loud and proud to showcase local bands
		 as well as hosting touring bands then look no further than the Rail Club. The Rail is
		 a must visit venue if you want to see and support up-and-coming local rock/punk/metal
		 bands. The stage and accoustics are good and the vibe is definitely chill but crazy all
		 at the same time. We frequent the Rail often and recommend adding it to your list.
